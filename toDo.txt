To Do:
Work out robust taxa matching
need to find script or rewrite script to generate bac_all_taxa.csv

from sim match
#need to expand to include higher level matches
#need to look into the robustness to the matching approach
#best approach maybe to work with directory names and fasta seq names
#fasta seq has unique id pathoscope returns, directory name has unique id

#Too many no matches - need to workout annother approach
- look into using the ncbi_taxonomy repository - in downloads directory

####
Keep in mind what versions/ resource files need to be locked down, namely pathoscope and 

# Use gi_taxid_nucl.dmp to get tid from gi numbers
need method to get tid from gi
have gi for pathoscope matches - need to get tid for source organisms

#note that the match_tid.R - function calls the NCBI database everytime.  Need to limit the number of calls.
